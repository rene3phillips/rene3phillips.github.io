# Portfolio - Natasha Phillips

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm Natasha Phillips, a passionate computer engineering student with a strong interest in web development, mathematics, and space exploration. I create engaging, interactive websites and apps that blend creativity with technical skills.

### About Me

I'm currently pursuing an engineering degree at the University of Central Florida, with a focus on frontend development. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Python, C++, and more. I enjoy applying my technical knowledge to build functional and visually interesting projects.

### Projects

Below are some of the key projects I've worked on:

- **BluSky Bot**: A Python-based bot leveraging the AT Protocol API to automate interactions (posting, liking, following) on the Bluesky social media platform. I independently created this project, and it is not affiliated with Bluesky.
- **BookNook**: An app that manages book collections. It integrates the Google Books API for searching and uses Firebase for real-time syncing and user authentication.
- **ToshTools**: A command line interface (CLI) to automate and simplify tasks for users, focusing on enhancing productivity and streamlining workflows.
- **90s Replay**: A nostalgic e-commerce site offering 90s-inspired products, featuring a shopping cart, product listings, and checkout functionality. 

### Skills

- **Programming Languages**: C, C++, Python, Java
- **Database & Information Management**: XML, SQL, PHP, JSON

### What's Next?

I am actively working on expanding my knowledge in frontend development while keeping an eye on creative projects that combine engineering with web design. If you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my work, feel free to get in touch!
